A small phonebook app made in the process of refreshing React, and learning MongoDB, Express and Node.

Concepts learned/reviewed:

React:
	-state for input handling, searching, and client side copy of phonebook entries
	-useEffect hook for delay in retrieving phonebook from backend
	-axios for server communication
	-JS in general

MongoDB:
	-setting it up on Atlas
	-document based, JSON like data format
	-interfaced through Mongoose
	-id is actually an objectID object

Express:
	-defining server responses for different type of HTTP requests
	-request handling goes through a series of middlewares (request logging, formatting, HTTP methods handling, error handling)
	-error handling
	-DB communication through Mongoose ORM
	-commonJS modules

Node:
	-creating a server instance from an Express app
	-creating a server instance with vanilla HTTP requests handling
